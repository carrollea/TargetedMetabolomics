# TargetedMetabolomics
R code for targeted metabolomics

The file " " is an R file that can be run on the command line. 
You can use this program if you have a large amount of target ions that you want to find in your MS data. 
This program automates the process by iterating through a data frame of target ions, scanning the MS data for peaks of those ions, making an extracted ion chromatograph from the data, and creating m/z spectra from the identified peaks.
